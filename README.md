Let's say the resultant word is TANGY

if the first guess is ADIEU, it gives 'DIEU' in Grey Color and 'A' in Yellow Color, Hence, it should be inputted as<br>
letters with incorrect positions (YELLOW COLOR) => A****<br>
letters that has to be excluded (GREY COLOR) => DIEU<br>
letters with correct positions in the format A*B** (GREEN COLOR) => -

and it displays a list of possible words filtered out by the above conditions and the same can be repeated till the correct word is found !

TODO :

1. util to fetch unique words with the conditions satisfied, that can be a better guess
